# Changelog

All notable changes to **easy-ai-clients** are documented in this file.
The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.13.1 - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Added fal.ai image cost metadata for `image.generate`, `image.edit`, and
  `image.remix` using the official pricing estimate API. Results are marked
  with `cost_source="fal_pricing_estimate_api"` and
  `cost_is_estimated=True`.

### Changed

- Centralized fal.ai unit-price estimation logic so image and video adapters
  share the same pricing estimate contract.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Added adaptive music preset prompt sizing with `style_prompts` variants and
  `voice_presets` maps containing `default_gender` plus sized male/female
  variants, so preset-based generation can retry smaller prompt text before
  raising `MusicInputLimitError`.
- Added OpenRouter image analysis documentation for 8 validated vision models,
  including pricing, validated parameters, and paid validation date.

### Changed

- Changed music style preset metadata from singular `style_prompt` and
  `voice_preset` fields to sized `style_prompts` and `voice_presets` maps.
- Changed ElevenLabs music generation to route `eleven_music`,
  `eleven_music_v2`, and `music_v2` to native `music_v2`, use internal
  `output_format=auto`, and use concise preset voice guidance for direct music
  prompts.
- Changed `image.analyze(..., api="openrouter")` to require explicit
  OpenRouter model IDs and forward model/kwargs without aliases.

### Fixed

- Hardened ElevenLabs music prompt assembly with language-neutral diction,
  diacritic, section-tag, pacing, and anti-artifact guidance while preserving
  the public `music.generate` success schema.
- Fixed OpenRouter image analysis cost refresh through
  `image.update_cost("analyze", ..., api="openrouter")` and provider-reported
  cost fields.

## 0.12.0 - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Added approved image-plus-audio avatar video targets for fal.ai OmniHuman,
  fal.ai VEED Fabric, Hedra Avatar, HeyGen Photo Avatar, and Replicate
  `prunaai/p-video-avatar` with mocked contract coverage and safe local
  documentation.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added the validated `easy_ai_clients.music` public dispatcher with deAPI,
  ElevenLabs, Google Lyria, and Runware ACE-Step music generation, status,
  download, local option metadata, style preset metadata, and lyrics prompt
  helpers.

### Fixed

- Hardened music timeout handling, public kwarg rejection, and result/error
  sanitization for the validated music dispatcher.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-06-03

### Removed

- Removed the broad unvalidated music dispatcher surface from earlier
  in-development work, plus related provider adapters, documentation,
  credential references, and tests.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Preserved safe provider async references across video submissions, status,
  result, and sync polling flows, including fal.ai queue URLs, Runway task URLs,
  Google operation URLs, and Hedra/HeyGen/Together/xAI task metadata.
- Updated sync video results to retain safe submission metadata alongside final
  provider responses for debugging and follow-up calls.
- Changed direct `video.download(..., video_url=...)` behavior to require
  `output_path` instead of silently returning `None`.
- Documented Hugging Face text-to-video `sync=False` as a synchronous
  signature-compatibility no-op.

### Fixed

- Fixed fal.ai video adapters so provider-returned `status_url` and
  `response_url` are used before reconstructing queue URLs from `model` and
  `request_id`.
- Redacted signed upload URLs, upload form fields, credentials, and
  credential-bearing URLs from normalized video `raw_response` values.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added HeyGen v3 support for speech, voices, compatible video operations,
  Video Agent, video translation, lip-sync, avatar creation, assets, webhooks,
  and account lookup through the public dispatcher layer.
- Added `easy_ai_clients.media`, `easy_ai_clients.webhooks`, and
  `easy_ai_clients.account` modules for reusable provider helper categories.
- Added current non-legacy provider gaps across existing audio, image, and
  video subcategories, including OpenAI/Groq/xAI/OpenRouter transcription,
  Deepgram Aura TTS, ElevenLabs sound and voice helpers, Hugging Face
  media adapters, DeepInfra/Mistral vision/audio paths, Together/xAI video
  adapters, Runway image/audio/video-with-audio paths, and Stable Audio.
- Added documentation pages for audio voice helpers, HeyGen media/webhook/account
  helpers, HeyGen video resources, and a cross-category operation example guide.

### Changed

- Expanded provider discovery, docs, environment templates, and contract tests
  for the HeyGen v3 integration.
- Standardized new media return metadata around `cost_usd`, `cost_currency`,
  `cost_is_estimated`, `cost_source`, and `cost_details`, while preserving
  image `cust_usd` as a legacy alias.
- Added documentation coverage tests so public dispatcher provider matrices stay
  linked from the provider docs index.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-05-18

### Changed

- Treated Deepgram `diarize_model` as a first-class transcription parameter.
- Stopped sending the adapter's default `diarize=true` when callers pass
  `diarize_model`, so Deepgram receives only the newer diarization selector.
- Rejected explicit Deepgram transcription calls that pass both `diarize` and
  `diarize_model` with a clear `ValueError`.
- Expanded Deepgram transcription provider metadata to include the effective
  Listen request parameters used for debugging and downstream analysis.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Changed Deepgram transcription to send one whole-input Listen request per
  `audio.transcribe(..., api="deepgram")` call, with no internal audio
  chunking or chunk-result merging.
- Kept explicit Deepgram fallback behavior as one whole-input attempt for the
  primary model and, when configured, one whole-input attempt for the fallback
  model.
- Reused `PreparedTranscriptionAudio` bytes, content type, file name, and
  duration directly for Deepgram uploads when provided.
- Documented that callers who need Deepgram segmentation for long media should
  segment before calling the library.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added `PreparedTranscriptionAudio` and
  `audio.prepare_transcription_audio(...)` for reusable transcription upload
  payloads.
- Added dispatcher-level transcription audio options for local normalization,
  upload format, codec, and bitrate without forwarding those options as
  provider-native kwargs.

### Changed

- Transcription dispatch now prepares audio once and passes reusable payloads
  to provider adapters while preserving normalized WAV as the default.
- Provider adapters now accept prepared transcription payloads without repeated
  local decode/export where the provider path can reuse them.
- ElevenLabs transcription now sends `file_format="other"` for encoded prepared
  uploads instead of marking them as `pcm_s16le_16`.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added `video.video_with_audio(...)`, `video.create_avatar(...)`,
  `available_video_with_audio_apis()`, and `available_create_avatar_apis()`.
- Added Hedra video-to-video, motion-control, and video-with-audio adapters
  with local asset uploads and catalog-backed credit estimates where available.
- Added Runway ephemeral uploads for local media, custom avatar creation, and
  create-avatar chaining for `video.avatar_video(..., create_avatar=True)`.
- Added optional fal.ai pricing estimate support when callers pass
  `billing_unit_quantity` or `unit_quantity`.
- Expanded video coverage with `video.video_to_video(...)` and
  `video.avatar_video(...)`, plus discovery helpers for both operations.
- Added Hedra video adapters for text-to-video, image-to-video, and avatar
  video using `HEDRA_API_KEY`.
- Expanded Fal.ai video model metadata and forwarding across text, image,
  video-to-video, motion/reference, and avatar/talking-video endpoints.
- Added Runway `gen4_aleph` video-to-video and `gwm1_avatars` avatar-video
  adapters, and limited Google Veo video extension support.

### Changed

- Restricted Google Veo video extension to Veo 3.1/3.1 Fast with 8-second,
  720p, single-output requests.
- Updated Runway avatar-video payload normalization to use official
  `runway-preset`, `custom`, `audio`, and `text` shapes.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added `easy_ai_clients.video` with dispatchers for text-to-video,
  image-to-video, motion-control, image lip-sync, and video lip-sync workflows.
- Added video providers for Fal.ai, Google Veo, and Runway where provider
  adapters are implemented, plus async status/result/download helpers.
- Added video provider documentation, environment variable references, tests,
  and package metadata updates for publishing.

### Changed

- Corrected Google Veo validation and payload generation to match current
  documented duration, resolution, person-generation, image, last-frame, and
  per-request video limits.
- Corrected Fal.ai text-to-video seed/frame-rate support and video URL
  extraction for Fal.ai responses that return `video` as a direct string.
- Corrected the fal.ai InfiniteTalk video lip-sync `num_frames` validation
  range to follow the embedded source-video plus audio request schema.
- Added contract-level video payload, docs/env consistency, and gated live
  smoke tests.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Standardized the public Fal.ai provider identifier to `falai` for text,
  transcription, and image operations. The old short text identifier is no
  longer supported.
- Updated transcription results to include explicit cost metadata:
  `cost_usd`, `cost_source`, `cost_is_estimated`, and `cost_lookup_error`.
  Unknown transcription cost is now `None` instead of a fake `0.0`.
- Added `audio.update_cost("transcribe", result, api="deepgram")` for
  post-hoc Deepgram Management/Usage cost lookup.
- Corrected transcription pricing behavior for Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Fal.ai,
  Fireworks AI, Speechmatics, and Together AI using current official lookup
  APIs or pricing tables.
- Changed Speechmatics default transcription language behavior to
  `language="auto"` and Together default transcription language behavior to
  `language="auto"`.
- Removed Deepgram's hidden default fallback to `whisper-large`; fallback is
  now explicit via `fallback_model`.
- Reworked transcription provider docs, configuration, usage, error, and
  provider matrix documentation.

### Removed

- Removed public Rev AI transcription support because it did not meet the
  no-concrete-language Portuguese validation contract.
- Removed unsupported transcription models:
  `base`, `base-general`, `whisper-tiny`, and `whisper-base` from Deepgram;
  `deepgram/flux`, `deepgram/nova-3-en`, and `deepgram/nova-3-multi` from
  Together AI.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Reworked `README.md` as a PyPI-safe long description with absolute GitHub
  links for repository files and directories.
- Added `docs/usage.md` with public dispatcher examples, normalized response
  structures, media input notes, streaming behavior, and cost update helpers.
- Updated configuration and error documentation to match the current
  dispatcher and provider-adapter behavior.
- Updated provider documentation examples to use the public
  `easy_ai_clients.text`, `easy_ai_clients.audio`, and `easy_ai_clients.image`
  dispatchers instead of private or removed provider import paths.
- Improved package metadata URLs and declared the README content type
  explicitly for PyPI rendering.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-04-25

This is the first fully working release of `easy-ai-clients`. The library was
rewritten from scratch around three operation-aware dispatchers and a private
provider tree. Earlier `0.x` releases on PyPI reserved the project name but
were not functional and have been superseded.

### Added

- `easy_ai_clients.text.generate(input_text, instruction=None, model=None, *, api, **kwargs)`
  unified dispatcher across 14 text/chat providers: `anthropic`, `cohere`,
  `deepinfra`, `deepseek`, Fal.ai, `fireworks`, `google`, `groq`, `huggingface`,
  `mistral`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `together`, `xai`.
- `easy_ai_clients.audio.generate(text, model=None, voice=None, language_code="en", *, api, **kwargs)`
  for speech synthesis with `deepinfra`, `elevenlabs`, `google`, `mistral`,
  `openai`, `together`, `xai`.
- `easy_ai_clients.audio.transcribe(audio_input, model=None, *, api, **kwargs)`
  for speech transcription with `deepgram`, `elevenlabs`, `falai`, `fireworks`,
  Rev AI, `speechmatics`, `together`.
- `easy_ai_clients.image.generate / edit / remix / analyze(...)` dispatchers
  covering `bfl`, `falai`, `fireworks`, `google`, `openai`, `openrouter`,
  `stability`, `together`, `xai` (`anthropic` and `groq` for `analyze`).
- Programmatic discovery helpers: `text.available_apis()`,
  `audio.available_synthesize_apis()`, `audio.available_transcribe_apis()`,
  `image.available_generate_apis()`, `image.available_edit_apis()`,
  `image.available_remix_apis()`, `image.available_analyze_apis()`.
- `text.list_models(api=...)` and `text.update_cost(result, api=...)` for
  providers that support live catalogs and post-hoc cost lookups (currently
  `openai` and `openrouter`).
- `image.update_cost(operation, result, api=...)` for providers that support
  cost refinement after the original call (currently `openrouter`).
- Public package marker (`py.typed`) and an explicit Python `>= 3.11` baseline.
- Documentation under [`docs/`](docs/) for configuration, providers, and
  errors, plus a refreshed `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- The library no longer auto-loads a `.env` file from the package directory;
  callers are expected to set environment variables explicitly or use
  `python-dotenv` themselves. This matches the behaviour documented in
  [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).
- Internal provider modules are private (the package directories use a leading
  underscore). Only the operation dispatchers and the package-level submodules
  are part of the public API.

### Removed

- Direct imports of provider modules such as
  `easy_ai_clients.text.apis.openai` are no longer supported.
- The `0.3.0` and earlier code paths were removed entirely; nothing from those
  releases is preserved beyond the public package name.
