# xAI Text API Wrapper

## A. Overview
- The wrapper targets the OpenAI-compatible xAI chat completions API.
- Raw generation endpoint: `POST https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions`.
- Live catalog endpoint: `GET https://api.x.ai/v1/models`.
- The project abstracts credential loading, message construction, parameter validation, streaming accumulation, result normalization, and local cost estimation where available.
- Provider-native kwargs are forwarded directly; documented parameters are reference metadata, and provider rejections are returned through the normalized public error shape.

## B. Account and access
- Create account / console: https://console.x.ai/
- API key docs: https://docs.x.ai/docs/quickstart
- Required environment variable: `XAI_API_KEY`.
- Access restrictions are provider-specific. The validation matrix records account, tier, route, overload, and not-callable blockers observed in this account.

## C. Official references
- https://docs.x.ai/docs/api-reference
- https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/
- https://docs.x.ai/docs/pricing

## D. Wrapper behavior summary
- Public function signature: `generate(input_text, instruction=None, model='grok-4-fast-non-reasoning', **kwargs)`.
- Current default model: `grok-4-fast-non-reasoning`.
- Default selection date: `2026-04-25`.
- Default selection source: live provider catalog, official pricing/model documentation, and source defaults.
- Tie-break reasoning: grok-4-fast-non-reasoning is the lowest-cost non-reasoning Grok text model validated as callable.
- Lowest-cost default policy: the wrapper sends only required text fields plus provider-required minimal output caps, when required. It does not enable tools, web/search, cache writes, structured output, premium service tiers, provider plugins, or explicit reasoning by default.
- Parameter validation policy: every kwarg must appear in the provider's documented parameter set for this wrapper context. Otherwise `UnsupportedParameterError` identifies provider/API, model, invalid parameter, supported parameters, and whether the parameter is known elsewhere.
- Streaming policy: `stream=True` is consumed internally; callers still receive the same normalized final dictionary.
- Public return contract: `request_id`, `cost_source`, `cost_usd`, `input_text`, optional `instruction`, and `output_text`, in that order.

|---|---|---|---|
| grok-4-fast-non-reasoning | grok | passed | validated |
| grok-3 | grok | passed | validated |
| grok-3-mini | grok | passed | validated |
| grok-4-0709 | grok | passed | validated |
| grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning | grok | passed | validated |
| grok-4-1-fast-reasoning | grok | passed | validated |

## G. Parameter-surface grouping
- Core text/chat surface: `model`, wrapper-built prompt fields, output caps, sampling, stop sequences, and streaming.
- Tool surface: `tools`, `tool_choice`, provider-specific tool config, and parallel tool options; omitted by default.
- Structured-output surface: `response_format`, OpenAI `text`, or Gemini `generationConfig.responseSchema`; omitted by default.
- Reasoning/thinking surface: provider-native `reasoning`, `reasoning_effort`, or `thinking`; omitted by default unless the caller passes it.
- Routing/tier/cache surface: router/provider/tier/cache controls; omitted by default except OpenRouter/fal usage accounting.

## H. Wrapper-to-provider mapping
- `input_text` and `instruction` are converted to provider-native prompt fields unless the caller supplies the corresponding native structure.
- All kwargs are validated first, then forwarded using their native names.
- `stream=True` switches to SSE accumulation and then normalizes the final response.
- No optional paid features are injected for lowest-cost behavior.
- Cost is computed from provider usage/cost fields when available, otherwise from local fallback pricing tables for known models.

## I. Python examples
### Minimal call
~~~python
from easy_ai_clients import text

result = text.generate(
    "Reply with OK.",
    api="xai",
)
print(result["output_text"])
~~~

### Explicit instruction and model
~~~python
result = text.generate(
    "Summarize this in one sentence.",
    instruction="Use plain English.",
    model="grok-4-fast-non-reasoning",
    api="xai",
)
~~~

### Provider-native options
~~~python
result = text.generate(
    "Reply with OK.",
    model="grok-4-fast-non-reasoning",
    api="xai",
)
~~~

## J. Pricing section
- Pricing snapshot date: `2026-04-25`.
- Pricing source: see the official references above plus provider usage fields or local fallback pricing tables in source.
- Pricing can change without a code change, especially for routers and model aliases.
- The wrapper omits premium tiers, tools, web/search, cache writes, and explicit reasoning by default to avoid surprise charges.

## K. Validation note

The bundled unit tests validate imports and dispatcher routing without calling paid provider APIs. Provider model catalogs, account access, prices, and rate limits can change independently of this package; run your own provider smoke tests with your credentials before relying on a specific model in production.
