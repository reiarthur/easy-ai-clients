# Project Context

## Overview

`easy-ai-clients` is a Python library that exposes public dispatcher modules for
text, audio, image, music, video, media, webhooks, and account helper
operations across multiple AI providers.

This file is the project-specific context map for future Codex sessions. It is
not a README replacement and it is not proof that validation passed in the
current task. It was refreshed from static inspection of the working tree.

## User-Provided Project Description

The user wants project-specific Codex context to live at
`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, not at the repository root. The README and release
handoff prompt should stay in English, while user-facing chat responses should
be in Brazilian Portuguese.

The user also stated that a private dotenv file for this project now lives
outside the repository at `../.env-easy-ai-clients`. Secret values were not
inspected.

## Purpose And Domain

The package normalizes common multimodal AI client workflows behind stable
Python dispatchers:

- Text generation through `easy_ai_clients.text`.
- Speech synthesis, transcription, and voice helpers through
  `easy_ai_clients.audio`.
- Image generation, editing, remixing, and analysis through
  `easy_ai_clients.image`.
- Lyric-based music generation through `easy_ai_clients.music`.
- Video generation and provider video resources through `easy_ai_clients.video`.
- Provider asset, webhook, and account helpers through
  `easy_ai_clients.media`, `easy_ai_clients.webhooks`, and
  `easy_ai_clients.account`.

The public contract is the dispatcher layer. Provider modules under private
`_apis` packages are implementation details.

## Main Execution Flows

### Public Import Flow

`easy_ai_clients.__init__` imports and exposes `text`, `audio`, `image`,
`music`, `video`, `media`, `webhooks`, `account`, and `__version__`.

### Dispatcher Flow

Public functions accept an explicit `api=` keyword and route to operation-specific
provider modules. Unknown or missing providers are validated by the relevant
dispatcher before provider-specific calls where the operation supports that
preflight.

### Music Flow

`music.generate(lyrics, model=None, *, api, style=None, prompt=None, **kwargs)`
validates a narrow provider/model matrix, resolves standardized model keys to
native provider model IDs, applies exact style presets when requested, rejects
removed public kwargs, dispatches to `music._apis.<provider>`, and returns a
safe normalized public dictionary.

Local music helpers `get_generation_options`, `get_style_presets`, and
`build_lyrics_prompt` do not call provider APIs.

### Video Flow

`video.generate` aliases text-to-video. The video package also exposes
operation-specific dispatchers for image-to-video, video-to-video,
motion-control, avatar-video, video-with-audio, avatar creation, image/video
lip-sync, HeyGen Video Agent, translation, and HeyGen resource helpers.

Async helpers preserve safe provider references such as `status_url`,
`response_url`, `result_url`, `task_url`, and `operation_url` when available.

## Main Components

| Component | Public Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `easy_ai_clients.text` | `generate`, `list_models`, `update_cost`, `available_apis` |
| `easy_ai_clients.audio` | `generate`, `prepare_transcription_audio`, `transcribe`, voice helpers, `update_cost`, provider discovery helpers |
| `easy_ai_clients.image` | `generate`, `edit`, `remix`, `analyze`, `update_cost`, provider discovery helpers |
| `easy_ai_clients.music` | `generate`, `available_apis`, `get_status`, `download_result`, `get_generation_options`, `get_style_presets`, `build_lyrics_prompt` |
| `easy_ai_clients.video` | Generation operations, HeyGen resource helpers, async helpers, provider discovery helpers |
| `easy_ai_clients.media` | `upload_asset`, `delete_asset`, `available_apis` |
| `easy_ai_clients.webhooks` | Endpoint, event, event-type, and secret-rotation helpers |
| `easy_ai_clients.account` | `get_current_user`, `available_apis` |

## API Endpoints And Contracts

This repository does not expose an HTTP server. Its API is the Python package
surface documented in `README.md`, `docs/usage.md`, `docs/operation_examples.md`,
and `docs/providers.md`.

Important return-contract notes:

- Text, image, audio, video, and helper failures generally return normalized
  dictionaries when the dispatcher can preserve the public operation shape.
- `image.generate`, `image.edit`, and `image.remix` keep the legacy `cust_usd`
  key while also filling standardized cost metadata.
- `music.generate`, `music.get_status`, and `music.download_result` keep only
  the safe public music schema and must not expose raw provider responses,
  credentials, auth headers, provider audio URLs, signed URLs, or large audio
  payloads.
- HeyGen destructive delete helpers require explicit `confirm=True`.

## CLI Commands And Scripts

No console script entrypoint or application CLI was found in package metadata.
The documented commands are development, validation, build, and release commands:

```bash
pytest
pytest tests/test_imports.py -v
ruff check src tests
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

## Jobs, Workers, And Automations

No standalone worker, queue, scheduler, cron job, or hosted service entrypoint
was found. Some provider adapters perform bounded polling, retry loops, async
provider-job status checks, or background model catalog warm-up inside library
calls.

## Configuration And Environment Variables

Credentials are read from environment variables at provider-call time.
`os.environ` is authoritative. Some text, image, music, and HeyGen helper paths
attempt to load `.env` from the current working directory, but application code
should load private dotenv files explicitly when it depends on dotenv behavior.

For this repository's gated live tests, `EASY_AI_CLIENTS_ENV_FILE` can point to
a private dotenv file. If it is unset, current live-test helpers look for
`../.env-easy-ai-clients`. Secret values were not inspected.

## Data, Schemas, And Persistence

No database, ORM, migration system, queue backend, or persistent storage layer
was found. Runtime data is passed through dictionaries, provider JSON payloads,
local or remote media inputs, base64 strings, and `pydub.AudioSegment` objects.

Audio transcription preprocessing supports local paths, supported URLs, bytes,
base64 strings, data URLs, `pydub.AudioSegment` objects, and reusable
`PreparedTranscriptionAudio` objects where the selected adapter supports them.

## External Integrations

The package integrates with third-party provider APIs over HTTP through
`requests` and `httpx`. Documented providers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
Cohere, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, DeepInfra, Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Together,
Fireworks, Fal.ai, Runway, Runware, deAPI, HeyGen, xAI, ElevenLabs, Deepgram,
Speechmatics, Stability AI, and Black Forest Labs.

The video avatar-video surface includes the Replicate
`prunaai/p-video-avatar` prediction adapter through `api="replicate"`.

Provider integrations should not be exercised in ordinary unit tests. Live tests
are gated and require explicit environment variables.

## Frontend Or UI

No frontend application, UI framework, template engine, or browser runtime was
found.

## Tests And Validation

Validation was not executed during this context refresh by rule of the
`project-context-generator` skill. Use the commands below as documented local
validation paths, not as proof of current pass status:

```bash
python -m compileall -q src tests
python -m pytest tests/test_imports.py -q
python -m pytest tests/test_documentation_coverage.py -q
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check src tests
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

Before running safe local tests, clear live-test gates in the current shell when
appropriate:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_VIDEO,Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_HEYGEN,Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_HEYGEN_PAID_VIDEO,Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_TRANSCRIBE,Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_TRANSCRIBE_MULTILINGUAL,Env:EASY_AI_CLIENTS_LIVE_MUSIC -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

The test suite includes gated live modules marked with `pytest.mark.live`.
Default local validation should not call paid provider APIs.

## Build, Deployment, And Operations

The project builds Python distributions with `hatchling`:

```bash
python -m build
twine check dist/*
```

Wheel builds include `src/easy_ai_clients` plus `docs`, excluding generated
live benchmark reports. Source distributions include `.env.example`, `src`,
`docs`, `tests`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and
`pyproject.toml`, excluding the large multilingual live-test audio archive.

Publishing is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` with `twine upload dist/*` and a
PyPI project token. No Dockerfile, Compose config, deployment manifest, or
runtime process manager was found.

## Development Conventions

- Public imports should use the dispatcher modules exposed from
  `easy_ai_clients`.
- Private `_apis` modules are implementation details.
- Adding or removing provider support usually requires coordinated changes in
  runtime code, `docs/providers.md`, provider docs, `.env.example`, tests, and
  `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Public docs are written in English.
- Live provider tests must stay gated and credential-free by default.
- Do not restore the old broad multi-operation music tree unless the user
  explicitly changes the current contract.

## Technical Debt And Attention Points

- There is no lock file.
- Credential-loading behavior is intentionally uneven across older helper paths;
  application code should set environment variables or load a private dotenv
  file explicitly.
- `image.generate`, `image.edit`, and `image.remix` preserve `cust_usd` as a
  legacy alias.
- Unknown costs are represented explicitly with `cost_source="unavailable"` and
  supporting warning or lookup metadata when available.
- Live tests can call paid provider APIs only when explicit gates are set.

## Uncertainties And Verification Notes

- Runtime behavior was not executed during this context refresh.
- Secret values in `.env`, `.env.*`, and `../.env-easy-ai-clients` were not
  inspected.
- Provider API availability, pricing, and model catalogs can change; verify
  against official provider documentation before changing documented provider
  metadata.

## Agent Notes

- Read this file first for orientation, then inspect task-relevant source files
  before editing.
- Treat the current working tree as the source of truth over this context when
  there is any mismatch.
